# 30-day-temperature 🌡️
📋 Description
This project simulates daily temperature data for a 30-day period using Python's NumPy library and visualizes it with Matplotlib. The temperatures are generated randomly based on a normal distribution, allowing a simple demonstration of data generation, basic statistics, and data visualization.

📊 What This Project Does
* Simulates daily temperatures based on a normal distribution (mean: 22°C, std: 3°C)
* Calculates:
   -Average temperature
   -Minimum and maximum temperatures
* Displays a line graph of temperature trends over 30 days
* Highlights the average temperature with a horizontal dashed line
